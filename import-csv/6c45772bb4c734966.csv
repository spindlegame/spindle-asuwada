Von 1852 bis 1877 war er selbständiger Redaktor dieser Zeitung. Ab den 1830er Jahren bis zu seinem Tod 1896 gab er den seit 1781 jährlich erscheinenden Züricher Kalender heraus. Ein weiterer Titel aus seinem Haus waren die Reisebegleiter für die Schweiz, die unter anderem Bahn- und Schiffsfahrpläne enthielten. Friedrich Bürklis Sammlung umfasst um die 1500 Titel. Bei etwa der Hälfte davon handelt es sich um orientalistische Fachliteratur des 19. Jahrhunderts, bei der anderen Hälfte um Drucke aus Europa, Ägypten und Indien in grösstenteils arabischer Sprache. Die Werke stammen von arabischen Autoren des 6. bis 16.

März 1826 als Sohn des Arztes Johann Jakob Heusser und der Dichterin Meta Heusser-Schweizer in Hirzel geboren. Heusser studierte zunächst Medizin an der Universität Zürich, danach Naturwissenschaften an der (späteren) Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, wo er 1851 promovierte. Danach war er im Privatlabor des Berliner Physikers und Chemikers Heinrich Gustav Magnus mit kristall-optischen Studien beschäftigt, die er 1852 bei Franz Ernst Neumann an der Universität Königsberg fortsetzte. 1853 wurde er als Privatdozent für Mineralogie an die Universität Zürich bestellt. Im Jahre 1856 unternahm Heusser im Auftrag der Kantone Zürich, Graubünden, Bern, Unterwalden, Glarus und Aargau eine Inspektionsreise nach Brasilien zur Überprüfung der Klagen von Schweizer Pächtern auf Plantagen bei São Paulo. Sein kritischer Bericht an die Zürcher Regierung führte zu einer Diskussion über die schweizerische Auswanderungspraxis. Ab 1859 lebte er in Buenos Aires, wo er als Geologe, Vermessungsingenieur und Landbesitzer tätig war. Heusser verfasste zahlreiche Aufsätze zur Geologie und Mineralogie Brasiliens, Argentiniens und der Schweiz sowie zur Auswanderung.

Jakob Christian Heusser, der 1871 Anna, geborene Smith, ehelichte, verstarb am 21. April 1909 in Buenos Aires. Er war der ältere Bruder von Johanna Spyri.

Heusser war seit 1851 mit dem Dichter Gottfried Keller befreundet. Im ersten Kapitel des Novellenzyklus Das Sinngedicht schildert Keller die Berliner Arbeitsumgebung seines Freundes im Magnus-Haus. ","3","77076564","1","Hirzel, Zurich, Switzerland"

Der Mann, der früher mit Hintansetzung seiner Lebenshoffnungen sich einem Mißbrauch unter dem alten Regiment entgegengesetzt hatte, der - die Wünsche und das in denselben begründete Wahlrecht einer Gemeinde ehrend - von seiner gesicherten Ernennung und von"" seiner jetzigen Gemeinde zurückgetreten war - der wurde nun in derselben Gemeinde als versteckter Aristokrat verschrien und als solcher einer langen, planmäßigen Verfolgung unterworfen. - 

Was ist das Urteil der Menge?

Gagern entstammte dem alten rügenschen Adelsgeschlecht von Gagern und wurde als ältester von sieben Söhnen des nassauischen Ministers Hans Christoph Ernst von Gagern geboren. Seine Mutter war eine geb. Freiin v. Gaugreben. Er ist ein Bruder des Präsidenten der Frankfurter Nationalversammlung Heinrich von Gagern und des Politikers Maximilian von Gagern. Als Westdeutschland 1795 zum Kriegsschauplatz wurde, folgten die Eltern dem nassauischen Fürstenhaus nach Bayreuth; erst 1800 kehrten sie nach Weilburg zurück. Gagern besuchte das Gymnasium, begleitete seinen Vater mehrfach auf dessen diplomatischen Reisen. Während der Jahre 1809 und 1810 hielt sich Gagern in Paris auf, um sich dort zum Besuch der École polytechnique vorzubereiten. Anschließend studierte er Rechtswissenschaften in Göttingen, Marburg und Gießen.

In Göttingen wurde er 1810 Mitglied der Corps Hannovera und Rhenania.[1] 1814 wurde er Mitglied der Burschenschaft Teutonia Heidelberg und 1817 war er Mitgründer der Heidelberger Burschenschaft. ",NULL,"59867444","1","Weilburg, Germany"

Von seinen Kindern - die Töchter stehn in meinem lebendigen Andenken - lebt nur noch die Frau Zeller-Wirz, die Freundin unserer frühen Jahre, bei ihrer Tochter, Frau Oberst Ott, in Zürich.

Ihm, dem Vater Wirz, hatten wir denn auch eine Freundschaft zu danken, die unsere Jugend mit eigentümlichem Glanze übergoß. 

Er hatte bei einem Aufenthalt auf dem Rigi (1805) die Bekanntschaft einer edlen Schwyzerin, Frau Ab-yberg-Reding, der Schwester des Eidgenossen ""ohne Furcht und ohne Tadel"" (Alois Reding [*57]) gemacht. 

Als nun am zwei ten September 1806 die furchtbare Katastrophe über das liebliche Alpental von Goldau [*58] eingebrochen war - nie werde ich den überwältigenden, vernichtenden Eindruck vergessen, den die erste Kunde von diesem furchtbaren Ereignis auf uns machte, und nun mein Vater gleich in der Woche nachher mit den drei ältesten Schwestern sich aufmachte, die Stätte der Zerstörung zu schauen, da gab ihm Freund Wirz einige Zeilen an seine Freundin in Schwyz mit, dem ein kleiner Briefwechsel folgte, indem es meinem Vater gelang, eine kleine Kollekte für die armen am Leben gebliebenen Bewohner des begrabenen Tales, die all ihr Hab und Gut Verloren hatten, bei seinen Freunden zu sammeln, welche er an die edle Frau ""im Grund"" adressierte. - 

Dies waren die Wurzeln einer Freundschaft, die - über manche Gräber hin, und nach jahrelanger Unterbrechung - immer wieder neue Zweige getrieben hat. ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Während einer Geschäftsreise wurde er im Juni 1859 in der Nähe der italienischen Stadt Solferino Zeuge der erschreckenden Zustände unter den Verwundeten nach einer Schlacht zwischen der Armee Österreichs sowie den Truppen Sardinien-Piemonts und Frankreichs. Über seine Erlebnisse schrieb er ein Buch mit dem Titel Eine Erinnerung an Solferino, das er 1862 auf eigene Kosten veröffentlichte und in Europa verteilte.[2]

In der Folge kam es ein Jahr später in Genf zur Gründung des Internationalen Komitees der Hilfsgesellschaften für die Verwundetenpflege, das seit 1876 den Namen Internationales Komitee vom Roten Kreuz (IKRK) trägt. Die 1864 beschlossene Genfer Konvention geht wesentlich auf Vorschläge aus Dunants Buch zurück. Henry Dunant, der danach aufgrund geschäftlicher Probleme und seines darauf folgenden Ausschlusses aus der Genfer Gesellschaft rund drei Jahrzehnte lang in Armut und Vergessenheit lebte, gilt damit als Begründer der Internationalen Rotkreuz- und Rothalbmond-Bewegung. Im Jahr 1901 erhielt er für seine Lebensleistung zusammen mit dem französischen Pazifisten Frédéric Passy den ersten Friedensnobelpreis. ",NULL,"37053483","1","Genf, Switzerland"
