März 1826 als Sohn des Arztes Johann Jakob Heusser und der Dichterin Meta Heusser-Schweizer in Hirzel geboren. Heusser studierte zunächst Medizin an der Universität Zürich, danach Naturwissenschaften an der (späteren) Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, wo er 1851 promovierte. Danach war er im Privatlabor des Berliner Physikers und Chemikers Heinrich Gustav Magnus mit kristall-optischen Studien beschäftigt, die er 1852 bei Franz Ernst Neumann an der Universität Königsberg fortsetzte. 1853 wurde er als Privatdozent für Mineralogie an die Universität Zürich bestellt. Im Jahre 1856 unternahm Heusser im Auftrag der Kantone Zürich, Graubünden, Bern, Unterwalden, Glarus und Aargau eine Inspektionsreise nach Brasilien zur Überprüfung der Klagen von Schweizer Pächtern auf Plantagen bei São Paulo. Sein kritischer Bericht an die Zürcher Regierung führte zu einer Diskussion über die schweizerische Auswanderungspraxis. Ab 1859 lebte er in Buenos Aires, wo er als Geologe, Vermessungsingenieur und Landbesitzer tätig war. Heusser verfasste zahlreiche Aufsätze zur Geologie und Mineralogie Brasiliens, Argentiniens und der Schweiz sowie zur Auswanderung.  Jakob Christian Heusser, der 1871 Anna, geborene Smith, ehelichte, verstarb am 21. April 1909 in Buenos Aires. Er war der ältere Bruder von Johanna Spyri.  Heusser war seit 1851 mit dem Dichter Gottfried Keller befreundet. Im ersten Kapitel des Novellenzyklus Das Sinngedicht schildert Keller die Berliner Arbeitsumgebung seines Freundes im Magnus-Haus.

Mai 1828 in Genf; † 30. Oktober 1910 in Heiden), war ein Schweizer Geschäftsmann und ein Humanist christlicher Prägung. Während einer Geschäftsreise wurde er im Juni 1859 in der Nähe der italienischen Stadt Solferino Zeuge der erschreckenden Zustände unter den Verwundeten nach einer Schlacht zwischen der Armee Österreichs sowie den Truppen Sardinien-Piemonts und Frankreichs. Über seine Erlebnisse schrieb er ein Buch mit dem Titel Eine Erinnerung an Solferino, das er 1862 auf eigene Kosten veröffentlichte und in Europa verteilte.[2]  In der Folge kam es ein Jahr später in Genf zur Gründung des Internationalen Komitees der Hilfsgesellschaften für die Verwundetenpflege, das seit 1876 den Namen Internationales Komitee vom Roten Kreuz (IKRK) trägt. Die 1864 beschlossene Genfer Konvention geht wesentlich auf Vorschläge aus Dunants Buch zurück. Henry Dunant, der danach aufgrund geschäftlicher Probleme und seines darauf folgenden Ausschlusses aus der Genfer Gesellschaft rund drei Jahrzehnte lang in Armut und Vergessenheit lebte, gilt damit als Begründer der Internationalen Rotkreuz- und Rothalbmond-Bewegung. Im Jahr 1901 erhielt er für seine Lebensleistung zusammen mit dem französischen Pazifisten Frédéric Passy den ersten Friedensnobelpreis. ","","37053483","VIAF   Virtual International Authority File"
