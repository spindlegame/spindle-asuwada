"3","Transcendental arguments","""… which consisted of “empirical and non-empirical” elements and often include a conditional conclusion. Their rhetorical power derived especially from the engagement of a rational being, i.e. a person, in a form of Socratic inquriy (p. 21). They had the force of increasing self-awareness or even the seduction to change another. But this was also its drawback. The speech partner could simply abandone the discourse. Chapman et al. (2013) believed that the “transcendental argument” necessarily implied the acceptance of “Kantian idealism. Hoppe’s self-ownership axiom was based on this sort of argument derived from Apel’s transcendental pragmatism"" (chp. III.2.3)<br>"
"4","Self-imposition arguments","""… finally, relied on “authoritative rational intuition” and stated that once one desired to achieve a goal it was binding for this person to act accordingly, albeit giving up the goal. This was the form of argument used by Hirzel. They bared the advantage of being “rationally binding”. Eventhough a performative contradiction in this argumentation could not enforce the original decision to desire being a person as a goal, but once such a decision was taken, it became indirectly binding. Thus, it perserved the principle of liberty in bindingness. However, “self-imposed arguments” were universal only in their form not in their content. For that reason, no universal affirmation in the sense of ‘all human beings are self-owners’ could be made, but only that ‘all beings which desire to be self-owners must be able to argumentation’. Another advantage was that those arguments did not rely on the acceptance of “transcendental idealism” ""(chp. III.2.4)<br>"
